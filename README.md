# Magnetic_Null_Detector
The IDL routine can give a first hand idea about the location and number of three dimensional magnetic nulls for a magnetic field configuration. It is assumed that the magnetic field components are given in Cartesian coordinates. The code given here is written to read magnetic field data from a .sav file.

The baic methodology behind the code is as follows. Since, each of the magnetic field components are given as Bx(nx,ny,nz), By(nx,ny,nz), and Bz(nx,ny,nz), one can estimate the magnetic field strength B = sqrt(Bx^2 + By^2 + Bz^2), which will also be three dimensional given by B(nx,ny,nz). Then the magnetic field strength vector B can be envisaged as three dimensional data cube constituted by nz number of two dimensional layers of size nx and ny in the x and y directions.
